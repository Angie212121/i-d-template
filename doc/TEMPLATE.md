# Using the Template Repository

A separate [template
repository](https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template) exists to
help people get started with this tool.  With that repository, setup is a very
simple process.

1. [Create a new repository using the
   template](https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template/generate)

2. Rename your draft and add a title.  The newly created repository will contain
   a link to a page where you can do this using the GitHub editor.

3. Enable GitHub Pages in the settings for the repository: ![choose the gh-pages
   branch and / (root), then hit "Save"](enable-gh-pages.png)

4. Edit the draft.

5. [Create a new
   release](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SUBMITTING.md#github-release)
   to submit a new draft to the IETF datatracker.

This uses all the same capabilities as the manual process, so contributors can
still choose to use command-line tools if that suits them.
